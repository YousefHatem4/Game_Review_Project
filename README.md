# Game_Review_Project
A responsive game review website built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. The project demonstrates my learning of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the use of import/export in JavaScript for modular and reusable code. It features dynamic content rendering, a clean design, and responsive layouts.
